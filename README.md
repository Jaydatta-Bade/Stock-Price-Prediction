# Stock-Price-Prediction-Using-Stacked-LSTM

### Steps
- Fetch the stock data using Quandl RESTful API from (https://data.nasdaq.com/users/login)
- collect the stock data
- preprocess the data - Train and test
- create an stacked LSTM model
- predict test data and plot the output
- predict future 10 days price and plot output

# Stock Price Prediction using ARIMA and SARIMA
- Autoregressive Integrated Moving Averages

### Steps -
- Visualize the Time Series Data
- Make the time series data stationary
- Plot the Correlation and AutoCorrelation Charts
- Construct the ARIMA Model or Seasonal ARIMA based on the data
- Use the model to make predictions
